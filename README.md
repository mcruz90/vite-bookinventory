# Book Inventory

A Book Inventory App built using Typescript and created using Vita. This was my first foray into learning Typescript and familiarizing myself with Vite. I also stuck to vanilla js. Book information is stored using localstorage.

## Future Implementations:

- Sort and Filter
- Moving from localstorage to a sql/nosql db
